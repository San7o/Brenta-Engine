/**
 * @brief System type
 *
 * This type is used to identify systems in the game world. Systems are
 * functions that process game objects and are called at any tick by the World.
 *
 * Systems can query an entity via It's components specified in the template
 * arguments. The system will be called each tick with a list of entities
 * that have all the components specified.
 *
 * Example of creating a system:
 *
 * ```
 * struct system_a : system<component_a, component_b> {
 *   void run (std::vector<entity> e) const override { std::cout << "A\n"; }
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * If no components are needed, use system<none>.

 * @brief Registered Systems Type
 *
 * This struct is used as a type to register systems in the World.
 * Use the REGISTER_SYSTEMS(...) macro to register systems, this
 * will create an instance of Registeres Systems with the systems
 * specified. This is used to call the systems in the World.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * REGISTERED_SYSTEMS(system_a, system_b);
 * ```
