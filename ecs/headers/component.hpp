/**
 * @brief Component class
 *
 * This class is used to create components. Components are used to store
 * data that is associated with an entity. For example, a Position
 * component could store the position of the entity.
 *
 * Example creating a component:
 *
 * ```
 * struct TransformComponent : Component {
 *   glm::vec3 position;
 *   glm::vec3 rotation;
 *   float scale;
 *
 *   TransformComponent() : ...
 *   TransformComponent(glm::vec3 position, ...
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * You need to provide a default constructor,
 * any other constructor is optional.
