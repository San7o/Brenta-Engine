# opengl-santo-engine

A friendly Entity Component System (ECS) engine, 
developed in C++ with OpenGL. This engine is designed to 
provide a modular and flexible architecture for game development
and simulations: you can run simultations without the graphical
interface through the custom made - from the ground up - ECS framework.
Or you could build any graphical application with OpenGL: the engine is
packed with easy to use and highly modular and customizable classes 
to handle most necessities like Input, 3D Model Loading, Audio, Time...

Check out `GUIDE.md` for an introduction on how the system works!
The engine is licensed with [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) license.

# ‚≠ê Current State

The project is structured into the folders `engine`, `ecs`, `game`, `render` 
containing respectively the game engine, the ecs, a game demo and a render demo.

The project is under heavy developement, the following features have been
implemented:

- [x] Textures

- [x] Camera

- [x] Shaders 

- [x] Lighting: Ambient, Diffuse, Specular

- [x] Model loading

- [x] Other OpenGL features: Texture transparency, Face culling, MSAA

- [x] ECS: Entities, Components, Systems, Resources, World, Query multiple components

- [x] Unit tests

- [x] Logging

- [x] Text engine

- [x] Audio engine

- [x] Simple Physics

- [x] Collisions: Spheres
