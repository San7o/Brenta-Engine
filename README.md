# opengl-santo-engine

A straightforward and simple Entity Component System (ECS) engine, 
developed in C++ and utilizing OpenGL for advanced graphics rendering. 
This engine is designed to provide a modular and flexible architecture
for game development and simulations.

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How it works

The `World` contains `Entities`. You can add `Components` to entities,
which are their "properties" (like Health, Position, Mesh). You interact 
with those components through `Systems` by making `Queries`. There are
also `Resources` that store global data. Components, Systems and 
Resources are identified by a name, while entities are defined with 
an ID.

Let's take a deeper look:

### Main loop

The main loop calls World::Tick(). At each tick, all the 
Systems will be called in the order they were added in 
the World. 

The engine provides functions to interact with the window in `ECS::Screen`, 
some OpenGL helper functions in `ECS::GL`, a nice `ECS::Logger`,
input handling with `ECS::Input` and more!

```c++
#include "engine.h"
using namespace ECS;

int main() {

    /* Set Log level, default = WARNING */
    Logger::SetLogLevel(Types::LogLevel::INFO);

    /* Initialize the screen */
    Screen::Init(SCR_WIDTH, SCR_HEIGHT);

    /* Load OpenGL */
    GL::LoadOpenGL();

    /* Initialize the world */
    World::Init();

    InitPlayer();
    InitRenderer();
    // ...

    while(!Screen::isWindowClosed()) {

        /* Clear */
        GL::SetColor(0.2f, 0.3f, 0.3f, 1.0f);
        GL::Clear();

        World::Tick();

        Screen::PollEvents();
        Screen::SwapBuffers();
    }
    
    World::Delete();
    Screen::Terminate();
    return 0;
}
```

### Component

A Component is a piece of data (more precisely, a struct) that gets assigned to an Entity. 

You can define your own component like so:

```c++
/* This is a component */
struct ModelComponent : Types::Component {
    Model model;
    Types::ShaderName shader;

    /* I added a constructor for ease of use */
    ModelComponent(Model model, Types::ShaderName shader)
            : model(model), shader(shader) {}
};
```

### System

A System is a function that gets called at each 
Tick in the reder loop. It contains all the logic of 
the World. You will interact with the Entities, 
Components and Resources via 
`World::QueryComponent({"component1", "component2", ...})`,
`World::EntityToComponent(Entity e)`
and `World::GetResource("resourceName")`.

Here is an example:

```c++
/* A system is composed of a name and a function */
auto renderer = std::make_shared<System>("Renderer", []() {

    /* Get the entities with the model component */
    auto matches = World::QueryComponents({"ModelComponent"});
    if (matches.empty()) return;


    for (auto match : matches) {
        /* Get the model component */
        auto model_component = static_cast<ModelComponent*>
             (World::EntityToComponent(match, "ModelComponent"));
        

        /* Translate the model */
        // ...
        

        myModel.Draw(default_shader);
    }
});

World::AddSystem(renderer);
```

### Entity

You can create Entities and assign Components to them like so:

```c++
/* Create the player entity */
auto player_entity = World::NewEntity();


/* Add the player component to the player entity */
auto player_component = std::make_shared<PlayerComponent>();
World::AddComponent(player_entity, "PlayerComponent", player_component);


/* Load model and shader */
// ...


/* Add the model component to the player entity */
auto model_component = std::make_shared<ModelComponent>(model, "default_shader");
World::AddComponent(player_entity, "ModelComponent", model_component);

```

### Resources

Resources hold global data accessible via `World::GetResource("name")`. You can define a Resource like so:

```c++
/* This is a resource */
struct WireframeResource : Types::Resource {
    bool enabled;
    WireframeResource(bool e) : enabled(e) {}
};


auto wireframe_resource = std::make_shared<WireframeResource>(false);
World::AddResource("WireframeResource", wireframe_resource);
```

### Callbacks

Callbacks are funciton that are called when the specified `key` is pressed,
the code responsible for this is in `ECS::Input`. Here is an example:
```c++
auto toggle_wireframe_callback = []() {

    auto wireframe = static_cast<WireframeResource*>(World::GetResource("WireframeResource"));
    if (wireframe == nullptr) return;

    GL::SetPoligonMode(!wireframe->enabled);
    wireframe->enabled = !wireframe->enabled;
};

Input::AddCallback(GLFW_KEY_F, toggle_wireframe_callback);
```

There are many other examples in the `examples` directory and in the `game` which is guaranteed to be updated to the lastest APIs.

Here is an high lievel simplified view of those objects:

# ü¶û Current State

The project is structured into the 3 folders `engine`, `game`, `render` 
containing respectively the game engine, a game demo and a render demo.

The following has been implemented on the engine:

- [x] Triangles

- [x] Textures

- [x] Camera

- [x] Shaders

- [x] Lighting
  - Ambient
  - Diffuse
  - Specular   

- [x] Model loading

- [x] Other OpenGL features
  - Texture transparency

  - MSAA

- [x] ECS
  - Entities
  - Components
  - Systems
  - Resources
  - World
  - Query multiple components

- [x] Unit tests

- [x] Logging module

# üíÄ Dependencies

You need

- A `C++17` compiler

- `GLFW` installed on your machine

If you are on `NixOS`, you can access the developement environment
by running:
```bash
nix shell
```

You need [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) in order to import 3D models. It is
advised to build the library for your platform following the instruction in the official
repository, but many linux distributions have it available in their packet manager. 
For linux, I built the library from source using the following flags:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/assimp/assimp.git
cd assimp/
cmake CMakeLists.txt -DASSIMP_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=off -DASSIMP_INSTALL=off
make -j4
```
The library will be generated in `lib/`. If you don't install the library system-wide,
you need to specify the path in an environment variable to run the application, like so:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PWD}/lib/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} ./build/main.out
```
Or you could compile the library statically with `-static`, but It will take more compile
time and generate a bigger file.

# ü™ñ Compile

You can compile the demo game with `cmake`:
```bash
cmake -Bbuild
cmake --build build
./build/main
```

Or with `make`:
```bash
# Demo game using the engine
make game
# Unit tests
make test
# Test rendering
make render
```

The binaries will be generated in `build/` directory.

## üî® Todo

- [ ] Physics

- [ ] Collisions

- [ ] Audio

## üë¥ Future

A GUI for the engine would be interesting to implement in the long future.
