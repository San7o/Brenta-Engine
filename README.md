This project aims to build a simple OpenGL application that
includes:

- [x] triangles

- [x] textures

- [x] camera

- [x] lighting

- [ ] model loading

- [ ] Optional: advanced features

## Vision

I want to build a functional ECS system for the engine, and run physics symulations.

# Dependencies

You need

- A `C/C++` compiler

- `GLFW` isntalled on your machine

If you are on `NixOS`, you can access the developement environment
by running:
```bash
nix shell
```

## Compile

You can compile the source with `make`:
```bash
make
```

The binaries will be generated in `build/` directory.
